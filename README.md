> ⚡ **Note**: Unla is under rapid development! We strive to maintain backward compatibility, but it cannot be 100% guaranteed. Please make sure to check version changes carefully when upgrading. Due to the fast iteration, documentation updates may sometimes lag behind.

## ✨ What is Unla?

**Unla** is a lightweight and highly available gateway service written in Go. It enables individuals and organizations to convert their existing MCP Servers and APIs into services compliant with the [MCP Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) — all through configuration, with **zero code changes**.

### 🔧 Core Design Principles

- ✅ Zero Intrusion: Platform-agnostic, supports deployment on bare metal, VMs, ECS, Kubernetes, etc., without modifying existing infrastructure
- 🔄 Configuration-Driven: Convert legacy APIs to MCP Servers using YAML configuration — no code required
- 🪶 Lightweight & Efficient: Designed for minimal resource usage without compromising on performance or availability
- 🧭 Built-in Management UI: Ready-to-use web interface to simplify setup and reduce operational overhead

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

Unla supports a ready-to-run Docker deployment. Full deployment and configuration instructions are available in the [docs](https://docs.unla.amoylab.com/getting-started/quick-start).

### Quick Launch with Docker

Configure environment variables:

```bash
export APISERVER_JWT_SECRET_KEY="changeme-please-generate-a-random-secret"
export SUPER_ADMIN_USERNAME="admin"
export SUPER_ADMIN_PASSWORD="changeme-please-use-a-secure-password"
```

Launch the container:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name unla \
  -p 8080:80 \
  -p 5234:5234 \
  -p 5235:5235 \
  -p 5335:5335 \
  -p 5236:5236 \
  -e ENV=production \
  -e TZ=Asia/Shanghai \
  -e APISERVER_JWT_SECRET_KEY=${APISERVER_JWT_SECRET_KEY} \
  -e SUPER_ADMIN_USERNAME=${SUPER_ADMIN_USERNAME} \
  -e SUPER_ADMIN_PASSWORD=${SUPER_ADMIN_PASSWORD} \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  ghcr.io/amoylab/unla/allinone:latest
```

### Access and Configuration

1. Access the Web Interface:
   - Open http://localhost:8080/ in your browser
   - Login with the administrator credentials you configured

2. Add an MCP Server:
   - Copy the config from: https://github.com/amoylab/unla/blob/main/configs/proxy-mock-server.yaml
   - Click "Add MCP Server" in the web interface
   - Paste the configuration and save

### Available Endpoints

After configuration, the service will be available at these endpoints:

- MCP SSE: http://localhost:5235/mcp/user/sse
- MCP SSE Message: http://localhost:5235/mcp/user/message
- MCP Streamable HTTP: http://localhost:5235/mcp/user/mcp

Configure your MCP Client with the `/sse` or `/mcp` suffix URLs to start using it.

### Testing

You can test the service using:

1. The MCP Chat page in the web interface
2. Your own MCP Client (**recommended**)

## 🚢 Fork Release Workflow

This fork publishes its own container images to GHCR:

- `ghcr.io/quocdatads4/unla/allinone:edge` on every push to `main`
- `ghcr.io/quocdatads4/unla/allinone:sha-<commit>` on every push to `main`
- `ghcr.io/quocdatads4/unla/allinone:vX.Y.Z` when pushing a version tag
- `ghcr.io/quocdatads4/unla/allinone:stable` when pushing a version tag

Recommended production flow:

1. Push changes to `main`.
2. Verify `edge` or `sha-<commit>` if needed.
3. Create a tag like `v1.2.3`.
4. Let GitHub Actions publish `v1.2.3` and move `stable`.
5. Redeploy Dokploy or Swiftwave using `stable` or a fixed version tag.

For the fork-specific Swiftwave private GHCR workflow, see [docs/SWIFTWAVE-GHCR-PRIVATE.md](docs/SWIFTWAVE-GHCR-PRIVATE.md).

### Required GitHub Actions secrets

To let the release workflow redeploy Dokploy after a version tag:

- `DOKPLOY_BASE_URL`
- `DOKPLOY_API_KEY`
- `DOKPLOY_APPLICATION_ID`

### Manual Dokploy redeploy

This fork includes a manual workflow:

- `.github/workflows/redeploy-dokploy.yml`

Use it when:

- you want to redeploy the current `stable` image without creating a new tag
- GHCR already contains the correct image, but Dokploy just needs a fresh deploy
- you want to redeploy a different Dokploy app by passing `application_id` manually in the workflow form

The workflow reads:

- `DOKPLOY_BASE_URL`
- `DOKPLOY_API_KEY`
- `DOKPLOY_APPLICATION_ID`

If `application_id` is left empty in the UI, it falls back to `DOKPLOY_APPLICATION_ID`.

### Manual Swiftwave image update

This fork now includes a manual workflow for Swiftwave:

- `.github/workflows/update-swiftwave-image.yml`

Use it when:

- Swiftwave already has a valid `imageRegistryCredential`
- you want to switch the app to `stable`, a version tag, or another explicit image
- you want to remove an old registry credential after the image becomes public

The workflow reads:

- `SWIFTWAVE_BASE_URL`
- `SWIFTWAVE_API_TOKEN`
- `SWIFTWAVE_APPLICATION_ID`

The workflow inputs let you:

- choose `docker_image`
- optionally override `application_id`
- optionally pass `registry_credential_id`
- optionally set `clear_registry_credential=true`

If Swiftwave does not yet have a GHCR credential, create it once with `sw.exe` first, then use the workflow for later image switches.
